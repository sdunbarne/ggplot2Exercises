** 4.5 Exercises

1) [@1] Draw a boxplot of hwy for each value of cyl, without turning cyl
    into a factor. What extra aesthetic do you need to set?

 #+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results graphics file :file graphics/ggplot2-chap4.5.1.png
 ggplot(mpg, aes(cyl, hwy, group=cyl)) + geom_boxplot()
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 [[file:graphics/ggplot2-chap4.5.1.png]]

2) [@2]    Modify the following plot so that you get one boxplot per integer value of displ.

      #+begin_src :export code
      ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty)) + 
                 geom_boxplot()
      #+end_src
		 
      Amazingly, the following, which was a guess, worked!

 #+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results  graphics file :file graphics/ggplot2-chap4.5.2.png
 ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, cty, group = round(displ))) + 
   geom_boxplot()
 #+end_src

 #+RESULTS:
 [[file:graphics/ggplot2-chap4.5.2.png]]

3) [@3]  When illustrating the difference between mapping continuous and
   discrete colours to a line, the discrete example needed ~aes(group
   = 1)~. Why? What happens if that is omitted? Whatâ€™s the difference
   between ~aes(group = 1)~ and ~aes(group = 2)~? Why?

    If ~group = 1~ is omitted from the ~geom_line()~, then get the following
    error message:
#+begin_quote
    ~geom_path~: Each group consists of only one observation. Do you need to adjust
    the group aesthetic?
#+end_quote

    There is no difference that I can see  between ~aes(group = 1)~ and
    ~aes(group = 2)~.  Even if I try ~aes(group=5)~ the graphic is the same.
    I am not sure why this should be.

4) [@4]  How many bars are in each of the following plots?

    #+begin_src  :export code
    ggplot(mpg, aes(drv)) +
        geom_bar()
    #+end_src
	
    3 bars, one each for "4", "f", "r".

    #+begin_src :export code
    ggplot(mpg, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = hwy)) +
       geom_bar()
    #+end_src
       
    3 bars, one each for "4", "f", "r", but now are shaded colour by hwy.

    #+begin_src :export code
    library(dplyr)  
        mpg2 <- mpg %>% arrange(hwy) %>% mutate(id = seq_along(hwy)) 
        ggplot(mpg2, aes(drv, fill = hwy, group = id)) + 
        geom_bar()
    #+end_src
	
    (Hint: try adding an outline around each bar with colour = "white")

5) [@5]  Install the babynames package. It contains data about the
    popularity of babynames in the US. Run the following code and fix
    the resulting graph. Why does this graph make me unhappy?

    #+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results  graphics file :file graphics/ggplot2-chap4.5.5a.png
     library(babynames)
     hadley <- dplyr::filter(babynames, name == "Hadley")
     ggplot(hadley, aes(year, n)) + 
       geom_point()
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:

 The following is better:
     #+begin_src R :session *R* :exports both :results  graphics file :file graphics/ggplot2-chap4.5.5b.png
     ggplot(hadley, aes(year, n, color=sex)) +
       geom_point()
     #+end_src

 In either case, "Hadley" is clearly a popular female name in the 21st
 Century.
