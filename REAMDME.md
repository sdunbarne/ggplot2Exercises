The following are my solutions to the on-line version of the
work-in-progress 3rd edition of /ggplot2: elegant graphics for data
analysis/ by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro and Thomas Lin Pedersen,
as of about March 2021.
The on-line site is https://ggplot2-book.org/

This document is an Emacs org-mode document with R code sections
exported to HTML with F. Niessen's ~readtheorg~ style.  In
addition to learning the Grammar of Graphics and ggplot2  by
working the exercises, it is also an exercise in creating and
exporting a document in org-mode that mixes both code and explanation.
This is my entry into literate programming and reproducible
research through the Emacs, Orgmode, and Org Babel with R ecosystem.

This document only covers most of the exercises up to
Chapter 18, since I don't have the understanding of functional
programming in the later section of Chapter 19 and beyond, and not
much need (yet) for the advanced methods.
